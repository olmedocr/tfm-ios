It makes use of [Circle CI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gabrielglbh/tfm-android) and [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) for automatic deployments to the Google Play Store and automatic tests using [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/), [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/) and [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso). For code coverage (what portion of code we covered with testing) we used [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/gabrielglbh/tfm-android).
